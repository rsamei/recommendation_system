Product Recommendation System with Sentiment Analysis
1. Data Preprocessing and Sentiment Analysis: 
Data Cleaning: 
The first step involved careful data preprocessing. Reviews were converted to lowercase, tokenized into individual words, and redundant stopwords were eliminated. The result was a clean dataset for further analysis purposes. 
Sentiment Classification: 
One of the key fundamentals in this project is difference between sentiment behind user reviews. Review classification using machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression and SVM was used to classify reviews into ‘positive’ or ‘negative’ sentiments. This classification was essential in providing crucial insights about user perceptions and product reception. 
Through surprise library, a model was trained to analyze user-product interactions. It takes historic data into account in predicting possible future users' and products' interactions as well, which can be used for improving recommendations according to the user's behavior patterns.
b. Content-Based Filtering: 
The attributes associated with brands and categories of products were taken into consideration in order to generate recommendations. By analyzing the similarity between various products under these attributes, the users were recommended according to their previously highlighted needs or preferences. 
3. Recommendation Enhancement Through Sentiment Analysis
Another step of sophistication was added when the recommendation algorithm combined sentiment scores. Products whose positive reviews were present across multiple categories over time got preferred recommendations and this ensured that recommendations made to the products weren’t only relevant but also well received by the user community.
Conclusion: 
This project shows how sentiment analysis can be seamlessly integrated with the recommendation systems. Carefully choosing data preprocessing techniques, sentiment classification, and a two-pronged approach towards making recommendations, users are presented with carefully curated product suggestions which align with their preferences as well as the broader user community’s approval.
